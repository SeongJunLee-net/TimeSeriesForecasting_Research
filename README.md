# TimeSeriesForecasting_Research

This is a repository of my research model design process with the guidance of Prof. Dae Jin Choi at the AIDML Lab, Department of Computer Science, National Incheon National University.

There are many kinds of designed models that I designed myself, and I perform the following two tasks.

Online-Learning
1Step Forecasting
For this purpose, I tried to predict using already existing deep learning time series forecasting models such as TFT (Temporal Fusion Transformer),

"Are Transformers Effective for Time Series Forecasting?,Ailing Zeng" [https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.13504]

I am inspired above paper, and then Developed other models basis on it.

I also tested the model proposed in the above paper with the following variations.

ðŸ’¡ Original model Using
ðŸ’¡ Using Multiple Kernel 
ðŸ’¡ Kernel with Attention

This is a different version from the one used in the current study, and all experiments were end. We will update the details as soon as Prof. Dae Jin Choi finishes writing our paper.
